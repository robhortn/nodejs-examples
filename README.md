# nodejs-examples
A place to keep my real-world code examples and notes for NodeJs application development and testing

# Getting Started
Clone the repo (or fork it) into the new repository you need to make. Run ```npm i``` to pull all the needed dependencies.

# Build and Test
The project supports typescript from the main application layer down. Typescript support is built into the appropriate npm scripts (start, test-coverage, etc.).
